- **bugfixes**
    - core: Error strings should not be capitalized (unless beginning with proper nouns or acronyms) or end with punctuation, since they are usually printed following other context.
    - docs: add note to current/future contributors to please start by opening a GH issue to avoid duplication of efforts
    - examples: typo in package name of examples
    - mpu6050: properly scale the outputs of the accel/gyro
